**A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework with World Model-Based Planning**

---

## Abstract

GeNesIS implements a population-based reinforcement learning environment where agents learn through world model-based planning (Dreamer V4 architecture) and multi-level emergent coordination. The system combines recurrent state-space models (RSSM), transformer-based attention mechanisms, and latent imagination for model-based policy optimization. This implementation explores the dynamics of distributed learning, cultural transmission, and architectural evolution in open-ended environments.

**Key Technical Contributions:**
- RSSM-based world model with GRUCell recurrence and transformer attention
- Dream-rollout planning with learned reward predictors
- Multi-objective auxiliary learning (communication, metacognition, prediction)
- Dynamic physics oracle implementing learned environment rules
- Population-level emergent behaviors through local agent interactions

## Neural Architecture: Dreamer V4

### Mathematical Formulation

The agent brain implements a world model-based reinforcement learning architecture inspired by Dreamer V3 (Hafner et al., 2023) with architectural modifications.

#### 1. Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM)

The world model maintains a recurrent latent state representation:

**Deterministic State Transition:**
```
h_t = f_θ(h_{t-1}, z_{t-1}, a_{t-1})
```

where:
- `h_t ∈ ℝ^D` is the deterministic recurrent state (D=128 or 256)
- `f_θ` is implemented as a GRUCell
- `z_t` is the encoded observation
- `a_{t-1}` is the previous action

**Observation Encoder:**
```
z_t = Encoder(o_t) = SiLU(LayerNorm(W_e · o_t + b_e))
```

where `o_t ∈ ℝ^41` is the 41-dimensional observation vector.

#### 2. Transformer-Based Actor

The policy network uses self-attention over the latent state:

```
Q_t, K_t, V_t = W_Q h_t, W_K h_t, W_V h_t

Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V

a_t = tanh(W_a · (Attention(h_t) + h_t))
```

where:
- Multi-head attention with 4 heads
- Residual connection: `h'_t = Attention(h_t) + h_t`
- LayerNorm applied before tanh to prevent saturation
- Output action: `a_t ∈ ℝ^21` (21-dimensional continuous action space)

#### 3. Value Function

```
V_θ(h_t) = W_v · h_t
```

Linear critic head projecting latent state to scalar value estimate.

#### 4. Reward Predictor

```
r̂_t = W_r · h_t
```

Learned reward model for dream-based planning.

#### 5. Dream Rollout

Imagination-based planning in latent space:

```
h̃_{t+k} = f_θ(h̃_{t+k-1}, ε_{t+k})  for k ∈ [1, H]
r̃_{t+k} = R_θ(h̃_{t+k})
```

where:
- `ε ~ N(0, 0.1I)` is Gaussian noise for stochastic transitions
- `H` is the planning horizon (default: 5-10 steps)
- `R_θ` is the reward predictor

#### 6. Auxiliary Heads

**Communication:** `c_t = σ(W_c · h_t) ∈ ℝ^16`  
**Metacognition:** `m_t = σ(W_m · h_t) ∈ ℝ^4`  
**Prediction:** `ô_{t+1} = W_p · h_t ∈ ℝ^41`  
**Concepts:** `φ_t = ReLU(W_φ · h_t) ∈ ℝ^8`

### Architecture Variants

| Component | 128D Variant | 256D Variant |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Hidden Dimension | 128 | 256 |
| Parameters | ~110K | ~420K |
| Target Use Case | Cloud deployment (100 agents) | Local GPU (96 agents) |
| Attention Heads | 4 | 4 |
| Planning Horizon | 5 steps | 10 steps |

## Environment Physics

### Physics Oracle

The environment implements a learned physics model mapping agent actions to outcomes:

```
Φ: ℝ^21 × ℝ^16 → ℝ^5
```

**Input:** `[action_vector (21D), local_matter_signal (16D)]`  
**Output:** `[Δenergy, Δhealth, Δposition_x, Δposition_y, interaction_cost]`

**Network Architecture:**
```
Input(37) → Linear(64) → Tanh → Linear(64) → SiLU → Linear(5)
```

**Initialization:**
- Orthogonal weight initialization with gain=1.5
- Energy bias: `b[0] = 0.4` (positive survival bias)
- Interaction bias: `b[4] = -0.2` (reduced drain)

### Resource Types

Resources emit spectral signatures in 16-dimensional signal space:

| Type | Color | Probability | Spectral Channels | Nutritional Value |
|------|-------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | Red | 70% | [0:4] | 50.0 (summer), 25-35 (winter) |
| 1 | Green | 20% | [4:8] | 50.0 (summer), 25-35 (winter) |
| 2 | Blue | 10% | [8:12] | 10.0 (summer), 400.0 (winter) |

**Seasonal Dynamics:**
- Period: 65 ticks (50 summer + 15 winter)
- Blue resources provide 8× nutritional value during winter
- Agents must learn temporal planning for survival

---

## Agent State Space

### Observation Vector (41D)

The agent receives a 41-dimensional observation at each timestep:

```python
[
    normalized_x,           # Grid position (0-1)
    normalized_y,           # Grid position (0-1)
    energy / 200.0,        # Normalized energy
    age / 200.0,           # Normalized age
    inventory[0] / 10.0,   # Resource type 0 count
    inventory[1] / 10.0,   # Resource type 1 count
    inventory[2] / 10.0,   # Resource type 2 count
    local_signal (16D),    # Environmental spectral signature
    nearby_signal (16D),   # Aggregated neighbor signals
    cos(internal_phase),   # Circadian rhythm
    sin(internal_phase)    # Circadian rhythm
]
```

### Action Space (21D)

The agent outputs a 21-dimensional continuous action vector:

```python
[
    move_x,         # Movement intent [-1, 1]
    move_y,         # Movement intent [-1, 1]
    consume,        # Gathering action
    reproduce,      # Reproduction trigger
    communicate,    # Signal broadcast intensity
    build,          # Structure construction
    ...             # 15 additional physics interaction dimensions
]
```

Each action is passed through the Physics Oracle to determine actual effects.

## Implementation Details

### Training Loop

```python
# Per-agent update cycle
observation = world.get_observation(agent)  # 41D vector
action, comm, meta, value, h_next, pred, concepts, log_prob = agent.brain(
    observation, agent.hidden_state
)

# Physics oracle determines outcome
matter_signal = world.get_local_signal(agent.x, agent.y)
effects = physics_oracle(action, matter_signal)

# Apply environmental changes
agent.energy += effects[0]
agent.x += effects[2]
agent.y += effects[3]

# Dream-based planning (every N steps)
if agent.age % 10 == 0:
    dream_states, dream_rewards = agent.brain.dream(
        start_state=h_next, 
        horizon=5
    )
    # Use imagined trajectories for value bootstrapping

# Update hidden state
agent.hidden_state = h_next
```

### Genetic Inheritance

Offspring inherit parent neural network weights with mutation:

```python
child_genome = parent_genome + N(0, mutation_rate)
child.brain.load_state_dict(mutated_weights)
child.hidden_state = parent.hidden_state * 0.7  # Partial state inheritance
child.inventory = parent.inventory  # Resource transfer
```

**Mutation Schedule:**
- Base rate: σ = 0.001
- Adaptive: Increases during population stress (low average energy)

### Population Dynamics

**Reproduction:**
- Energy cost: 50 units
- Cooldown: 50 ticks
- Spatial: Offspring placed in adjacent cell

**Death:**
- Energy depletion (E < 0)
- Apoptotic information transfer: Dying agents broadcast learned patterns to neighbors

**Equilibrium:** Population stabilizes through energy-constrained reproduction.

## Theoretical Background

### World Models in RL

The Dreamer architecture extends model-based RL by learning a compact latent representation of environment dynamics. This enables:

1. **Sample Efficiency:** Learn from imagined trajectories without environment interaction
2. **Long-Horizon Planning:** Reason about future states beyond immediate actions
3. **Transfer Learning:** Shared world model across tasks

- Hafner et al. (2020). "Dream to Control: Learning Behaviors by Latent Imagination." *ICLR*

### Emergent Coordination

Population-level behaviors emerge from local agent-agent interactions without central control:

- **Stigmergy:** Environmental modification creates coordination signals
- **Self-Organization:** Spatial patterns arise from local rules
- **Cultural Evolution:** Behavioral patterns transmitted across generations

**References:**
- Dorigo et al. (2013). "Swarm Intelligence: From Natural to Artificial Systems."
- Axelrod (1997). "The Complexity of Cooperation."

### Neural Architecture Search

The system implements differentiable architecture search through learned pruning masks:

```
P(keep_weight) = σ(logit_i)
```

Allows agents to optimize their own neural topology during lifetime.

## Experimental Extensions

### Suggested Research Directions

1. **Multi-Modal Environments:** Add visual observations via CNN encoders
2. **Curriculum Learning:** Progressive difficulty through environmental parameters
3. **Opponent Shaping:** Study co-evolution of competitive strategies
4. **Interpretability:** Analyze learned world models through probing tasks
5. **Transfer Experiments:** Pre-train in one environment, adapt to another

### Modification Guide

**Change Planning Horizon:**
```python
# genesis_brain.py, line 191
def dream(self, start_state, horizon=15):  # Increase from 5
```

**Add Custom Auxiliary Head:**
```python
# genesis_brain.py, line 95
class GenesisBrain(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.custom_head = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
    
    def forward(self, ...):
        custom_output = self.custom_head(h_next)
        return ..., custom_output
```

**Modify Physics Oracle:**
```python
# genesis_world.py, line 22
class PhysicsOracle(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Add gravity well centered at (20, 20)
        self.gravity_center = torch.tensor([20.0, 20.0])
```

```python
# Set seeds for reproducibility
import random
import numpy as np
import torch

seed = 42
